# Portfolio project: MyLynch web application for patients with Lynch syndrome

The tool is a R Shiny application that produces a website where Lynch patients can get personalized cancer risks as well as information on risk reducing measures available to them. Users have the ability to download or email their customized report to themselves and they can also share the website via social media and email share buttons. The tool encourages users to share their diagnosis, and the tool, with at risk family members with the goal of increasing cascade testing rates.

The intent of this public repository is to view the code for the app only. The proprietary data behind the app has been excluded and the code cannot be run without it. To see the working app, go to http://mylynch.org.
